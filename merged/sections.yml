  :text: "Makerspace\r\n\r\nThe makers movement is transforming consumers into creaters.
    By sharing otherwise expensive tools, it allows everyone to start exploring and
    producing through otherwise inaccessible means.\r\nIn Finland this builds on the
    traditional adult education and expands it into new technologies like electronics
    and 3d printing.\r\nWe start with traditional tools that we know and have, like
    woodworking, sowing, and metalworking. And we will expand into electronics and
    3d technologies as funding starts coming. (See wish-list below if you want to
    help)"
