  :text: "Makerspace\r\n\r\nThe makers movement is transforming consumers into creaters.
    By sharing otherwise expensive tools, it allows everyone to start exploring and
    producing through otherwise inaccessible means.\r\nIn Finland this builds on the
    traditional adult education and expands it into new technologies like electronics
    and 3d printing.\r\nWe start with traditional tools that we know and have, like
    woodworking, sowing, and metalworking. And we will expand into electronics and
    3d technologies as funding starts coming. (See wish-list below if you want to
    help)"

    Several floors of the building are reserved for artist studios. Some creative
    activities that require large equipment (presses, ovens) overlap strongly with

  :text: We offer different sizes and different types of studios for artists. There
    large and small rooms, with more or less light, also rooms with tiles for wet-work.
    The rooms are in the old hospital wings, so most are old patient rooms, but there
    are plenty of others too. Prices do not include electricity or vat, but do include
    the use of common spaces, see below.
