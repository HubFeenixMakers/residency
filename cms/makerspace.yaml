  header: Makerspace
  text: "Makerspace\r\n\r\nThe makers movement is transforming consumers into creaters.
    By sharing otherwise expensive tools, it allows everyone to start exploring and
    producing through otherwise inaccessible means.\r\nIn Finland this builds on the
    traditional adult education and expands it into new technologies like electronics
    and 3d printing.\r\nWe start with traditional tools that we know and have, like
    woodworking, sowing, and metalworking. And we will expand into electronics and
    3d technologies as funding starts coming. (See wish-list below if you want to
    help)"

    3d printers can be used to print aluminium and carbon fibre to produce usable
    machine parts.\r\nComputers and software for designing are available."

  text: "The thrid floor makerspace already has some sowing machines and will get
    more. We are sourcing industrial sawing and embroidering machines so no project
    is too big (or small). The large rooms is set up for a shared working environment,
    enabling knowledge to be shared easily.\r\nPrivate lockers make it easy to interrupt
    and return to your project in your own time."

  text: "The building has a garage workshop and we will move our metal workshop there.
    There is a saw, drills, different welders (gas, stick, mig) and wrenches to allow
    members to build the robot of their dreams, or fix their car.\r\nSmaller side
    rooms allow for private and more detailed work, and we are looking to get a  lathe,
    possibly also a cnc machine."

  header: Participate
  text: "If you want to use any of the facilities or machines listed above, you need
    to be a member of the coop. This requires a small fee and a certain amount of
    participation in general tasks.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAdditionally some machines will
    require skill to operate, and you need to prove that you are able, possibly participate
    in training.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nConsumables, like wood, thread, clay, electronic
    parts, cost but many basic ones are made available at cost price by the coop.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCurrently
    many of the facilities are still being built up, but if you want to participate
    already, or be notified when a certain facility is ready, fill the form below.\r\n\r\nâ€‹"
