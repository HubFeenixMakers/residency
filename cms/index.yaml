  header: Residency and Accommodation
  text: We offer short to medium term accommodation for several target groups. The
    rooms are generally of a corridor, either with or without own toilet and shower.
    This can suit artists who either rent a studio or use co-working facilities. But
    we also accept applications from people who are just between things.
