  header: Sizes and kinds
  text: We offer different sizes and different types of studios for artists. There
    large and small rooms, with more or less light, also rooms with tiles for wet-work.
    The rooms are in the old hospital wings, so most are old patient rooms, but there
    are plenty of others too. Prices do not include electricity or vat, but do include
    the use of common spaces, see below.

  - header: Standard
    text: This is the standard 2 patient room. They are mostly towards the south,
      so may have great, or too much light, depending on how you see it. The size
      is about 3x5, cost 120e.

  - header: Large
    text: The old 4 patient rooms are basically twice the size as the small. They
      are large enough to be shared. The size is about 30m2 and the cost 240e. Like
      the small rooms these are south facing, very light.
