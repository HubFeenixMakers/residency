  text: Hub Feenix is a place to create together. A community of artists and makers.
    Several floors of the building are reserved for artist studios. Some creative
    activities that require large equipment (presses, ovens) overlap strongly with
    the Makers idea. Have a look at the rooms available and tell us what you need.

  header: Sizes and kinds
  text: We offer different sizes and different types of studios for artists. There
    large and small rooms, with more or less light, also rooms with tiles for wet-work.
    The rooms are in the old hospital wings, so most are old patient rooms, but there
    are plenty of others too. Prices do not include electricity or vat, but do include
    the use of common spaces, see below.

  - header: Standard
    text: This is the standard two patient room. They are mostly towards the south,
      so may have great, or too much light, depending on how you see it. The size
      is about 3x5, cost 120e.

  - header: Large
    text: The old four  patient rooms are basically twice the size as the small. They
      are large enough to be shared. The size is about 30m2 and the cost 240e. Like
      the small rooms these are south facing, very light.

    header: Wet spaces
    text: If your work requires you to get dirty, we have different size wet rooms.
      Here we are talking about spaces with floor drains that are tiled all around.
      There are about 2-3 per floor, in different sizes, from 12 to 25m2.

      of a fold-out bed to stay overnight.\r\nIt's like a home away from home."

    header: Shared kitchen, own sink
    text: Each floor has it's own common kitchen. This is especially useful if you
      take the option of a fold out bed to stay overnight. And almost all spaces have
      a sink in the room, so you can clean things or make a tea in peace.
